#LJ Code 201 - Day 2
----

Learned about arrays of great depth and how to locate things inside of them and what would happen if the furthest level of array was then searched, itself.
Very helpful stuff.
Also learned how to get out of endless loops. MORE helpful stuff.
I'd probably have a few more thoughts and reflections, but I'm pretty braindead after the lab today.
