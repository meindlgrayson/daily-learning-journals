# LJ Code 201 - Day 4
----

Paired Programming! Loved it! It's amazing having two minds working on the same project as there are so many different paths and possibilities to explore
in js and all language in general. There's someone to catch your typos and follow your brackets as well. All around great experience
and now I'm looking forward to working along-side other on solo projects as well.
