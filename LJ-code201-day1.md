# LJ Code 201 - Day 1
----
Today I've lerned a good bit more about git, though I'm still a bit iffy on it. 
This whole markdown thing was a bit of a surprise as well. I now kinda know how to do this..
The "double equals vs triple equals" dabate was finally explained to me as well!
Still a bit rusty in the terminal and hope to clear up those problems in the near future.
Great day, overall.
